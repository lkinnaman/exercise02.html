  <h2>Verse 1</h2>
    <p>
    <i>I see trees of green,
    <br>Red roses too
    <br>I see them bloom
    <br>For me and for you
    <br>And I think to myself
    <br>What a wonderful world...</i>
   </p>
  <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <p>
     I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
      <br>the bright blessed day, the dark sacred night.
      <br>And I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
